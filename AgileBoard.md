This page is for us to update regularly and is my thinking of an agile board that we can all see and collaborate on together.


To do:
  - Create plots of the loss data. 
        Details: For the file /checkpoints/<project_name>/**loss_log.txt** contains the loss data for the particular models training and outputs the loss values at each iter and epoch of the training. Create a plot to visualize any data that can be taken from this for the final presentation.
        Also could be used to start investigating overfitting and how long we should train for
  - Examining the videos we have to notice patterns for optimal video generation. 
       - Type of video (short, long, simple, complex, repeat motion, etc)
  - Keep training more videos to notive more patterns

Doing:
  - Make readme and set up project to be better collaborative - (Kyle 3)
  
  
Ideas to explore:
- given the current steps I am using via gcp instance (same as on readme) I am not sure I am fully utilizing the gpu but instead think I might be running the program on the vm's cpu which is why training takes so long - Kyle
